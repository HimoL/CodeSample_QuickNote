This is an Online Quick Note web app developed for the Code Challenge for Zenefits.
The requirement is to create a mobile web app that allows you create, edit, and view short notes. Notes are just small textual items, like to-do lists.
- Notes should be stored using browser local storage
- The app should be usable on a standard mobile browser


To run the web app, click to open the index.html file.

To test is in mobile devices, you can access:

This web app works well in mainstream mobile browsers like Safari, Chrome, Opera, Dolphin..

If you are using Safari and your Safari seems doesnâ€™t support for Localstorage, you can either close the Block function in Safari settings or attach the web page to home screen, then you will be able to use it.
